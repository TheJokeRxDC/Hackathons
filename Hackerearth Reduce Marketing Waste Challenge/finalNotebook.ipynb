    "\n",
    "* Increased business\n",
    "* New customers who are compatible with your organization\n",
    "* Seamless transactions with a higher success rate\n",
    "* More profit with fewer obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your company has products that can be used for hiring assessments. Your task is to predict the probability percentage that a client will purchase a product from the features provided in the dataset that is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>score = max(0, 100-np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(actual, predicted)))</code>\n",
